# Simple Calculator

Build a simple calculator using Vue.js 3.
The calculator should allow the user to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Requirements

- The calculator should have a display area that shows the current calculation or result.
- The calculator should have buttons for each of the numbers from 0-9.
- The calculator should have buttons for each of basic arithmetic operations.
- The calculator should have a button for clearing the display area
- Users should be able to input numbers and decimal points using the calculator's buttons.
- Users should be able to perform basic arithmetic operations using the calculator's buttons.
- Users should be able to clear the calculator's display and reset the calculation.

# Bonus

- Implement keyboard support so that users can input numbers and perform operations using their keyboard.

## Other Considerations

> If you see the `data-test` attribute anywhere in the boilerplate don't remove it.

> TailwindCSS is preinstalled with the default config. It might be helpful for you, if you want to have some styles. (Not obligatory)

## Example of Finished App

This is an example of what the functionality should look like for the completed exercise.
